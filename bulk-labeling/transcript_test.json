He's struck a lamp post, they're trapped in the car at the moment. The Ford driver has said that he's just come round the roundabout quite normally and the back ends's got away from him. In my experience that doesn't just happen. Fords are notorious for having quite slippy in corners because the rear wheel drive in most of them. But so I know that generally he's obviously put his foot down a little bit, which has got away from him. He's not been able to drive it properly. So someone's came a cropper because of his driving. So we'll do a couple of procedures with him to make sure that he's not over the limit or anything like that. And then we'll we'll get an injury update for the driver of the other vehicle.

So I the it probably taught talks for itself. The fact that he's came off his motorcycle just a week prior on Park Side pass and injublue himself. It sounds like he's a bit of a speed demon. And we've got footage of another car behind him which is all suited up, and his girlfriend's told her that they've they've been both revving their engines at the lights and potentially a bit of racing, a bit of showboating for each other and both nice cars. So, yeah, he's. I think he's been doing a bit of showing off and all this. Unfortunately for him, he's came a cropper in there on the roundabout and now someone else has been injublue because of his actions and his ego driving cars, which are too fast and driving well beyond his capabilities. So you'll be getting reported for he's getting reported for careless driving. We'll be putting a notice on his car now, and him, if he's going to drive like that again, then we'll be taking his car off him.",
